## Using NASA Api to get  images

**APIproj5** is an android app that **"displays a photos from NASA API using a button")**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [ ] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed



## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **NASA API**.

In order to resolve 300s timeout it was necessary to wipe data in Device Manager.
Went to View > Tool Windows > Device Manager to open Device Manager
